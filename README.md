 # ðŸ‘‹Hello, I'm Rejoice!

### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently diving into the world of data analysis and I'm excited to share my journey and projects here. My goal is to continuously learn and grow while contributing to the community and learning from others.

I intend on sharing my hands-on projects as i learn new tools and techniques. I'm open to learning from others and collaborating on interesting projects.

 I love immersing myself in new topics and expanding my knowledge, I enjoy cooking on my free days and building relationships and learning from different perspectives is something I highly value.
